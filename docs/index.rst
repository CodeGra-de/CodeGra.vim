CodeGrade Vim Plug-in
======================================

Even though the CodeGrade filesystem works together with any editor by manually
editing its special files, it is recommended to use it in combination with
editor plugins. CodeGrade offers a plugin for `Vim <https://www.vim.org/>`__,
*the editor*. This plugin is also known as *CodeGra.vim*.

The code of the CodeGrade vim Plug-in is open-source and can be found on
`Github <https://github.com/CodeGra-de/CodeGra.vim>`__.
